Operating systems provide automatic updates to users computer software. The updates can be scheduled at a specific time or can be done whenever they become available. Updates to operating systems are important because they can patch vulnerabilities in the software. Automatic updates can update multiple software applications at the same time.

Operating systems monitor computer performance. You can open up a task window in order to see how your CPU is being used and how much RAM is being taken up. You can also see how much room is left on your disk drives and judge whether you need to delete some files or add more storage. If you are doing something really intense like computer gaming, you can see how hot the components in your computer are getting.
